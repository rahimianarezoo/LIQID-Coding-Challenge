# LIQID-Coding-Challenge
- I used the BEM naming convention since it is less confusing than the other methods but still provides the good architecture.
- I didn’t use “sanitize.css”, it was making some difficulties for me (lack of some CSS attributes for resetting the default styling of the elements e.g not removing the unwanted margin/padding of ul). Therefore I just used some parts of it that I needed and put it in the “reset.css” file.
- There are some minor space changes in the final implementation that I applied, because I found it easier to maintain.
- The mockup was provided in only two resolustions, one for 1920px and one for the mobile, but since my display has 1366px width, I provided three more breakpoints (1366, 1024, 768) to make it look better on those screens as well.
